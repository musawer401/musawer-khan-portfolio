                         Social media marketing is the use of social media platforms
                             and websites to promote a product or service.[1] Although
                              the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant
                               in academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for
                                both practitioners and researchers.[2] Most social media platforms
                                 have built-in data analytics tools, enabling companies to track the 
                                 progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. Companies address 
                                 a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including 
                                 current and potential customers, current and potential employees
                                 , journalists, bloggers, and the general public. On a strategic 
                                 level, social media marketing includes the management of a 
                                 marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. mor
                                 e active or passive use) and the establishment 
                                 of a firm's desired social media "culture" and "tone."

                        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet <br>
                            (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can<br>
                            range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex <br>
                            web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.<br>
                             A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly<br>
                              refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,<br> 
                              client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network<br>
                              security configuration, and e-commerce development.<br>
        
                            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design<br>
                             aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may<br>
                              use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.<br>
                            
                            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of <br>
                            hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile<br>
                             methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only<br>
                              require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment <br>
                              to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. <br>
                              Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain<br>
                               of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <br>
                               front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end <br>
                               developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,<br>
                                while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of <br>
                                the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry <br>
                                has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

                    <p>The start of the web and web design
                        In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee<br>  proposed to create a global hypertext project,<br>  which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born.<br>  Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina,<br>  created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers,<br>  however the majority of them were Unix-based and <br> naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to<br>  graphic design elements such as images or sounds.<br>  The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was<br>  created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web<br>  to its full potential by developing common protocols<br>  that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[4] This<br>  discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser<br>  and programming language, which could have altered <br>  effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards,<br>  which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. <br> In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp.<br>  that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape <br> created its own HTML tags without regard to<br>  the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1<br>  included tags for changing background<br>  colours and formatting text with tables on web pages.<br>  Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began,<br>  as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance.<br>  During this time there were many new technologies in<br>  the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML.<br>  On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive<br> creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace</p>
